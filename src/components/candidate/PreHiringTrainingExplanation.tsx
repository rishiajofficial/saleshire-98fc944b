            This short training is designed to give you a quick overview of the job role through brief videos. 
            It helps you understand the key concepts and decide if you're interested in this position.

            You'll also take a short quiz to show how much you've grasped. This helps the manager see how 
            coachable you are in this area â€” even if you're not an expert yet.

          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed font-medium">
            Please watch the videos carefully and complete the quiz to move forward in your application journey.
